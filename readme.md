This simulates the last two races of the 2016 F1 season, Brazil and Abu Dhabi, based on probabilities collected from all races since the start of the Turbo Hybrid V6 engine era (the beginning of season 2014). 


It consistently predicts about 85% chance for rosberg, to 15% for hamilton -- these are the only two drivers still in championship contention. I plan to add more reporting features (histograms, etc.).
